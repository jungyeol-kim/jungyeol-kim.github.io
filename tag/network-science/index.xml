      <title>Coevolution in Multiplex Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Agents in complex systems interact in many ways: People are influenced by multiple channels of social interaction such as friendship and work partnership, and multiple means of transportation such as avian and ground transportation constitute the global transportation infrastructure. Such systems can best be represented as multiplex networks with multiple types of links. Each link type in the system defines a network layer, which is by no means in isolation but coexists and cooperates with other layers to fulfill the system’s function. Such coupling and interplay of network layers can result in emergent structural and dynamical impact in nontrivial ways, rendering the understanding based on the single-network approach incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards understanding such multiplex systems, we propose a modeling framework based on coevolution of network layers, with a class of minimalistic growing network models as working examples. We examine how the entangled growth of coevolving layers can shape the network structure and show analytically and numerically that the coevolution can induce strong degree correlations across layers, as well as modulate degree distributions. We further show that such a coevolution-induced correlated multiplexity can alter the system’s response to the dynamical process, exemplified by the suppressed susceptibility to a social cascade process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Correlated multiplexity and connectivity of multiplex random networks</title>
      <link>https://jungyeol-kim.github.io/project/multiplex-networks-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nodes in a complex networked system often engage in more than one type of interactions among them; they form a multiplex network with multiple types of links. In real-world complex systems, a node’s degree for one type of links and that for the other are not randomly distributed but correlated, which we term correlated multiplexity. In this paper, we study a simple model of multiplex random networks and demonstrate that the correlated multiplexity can drastically affect the properties of a giant component in the network. Specifically, when the degrees of a node for different interactions in a duplex Erdo ̋s–Re ́nyi network are maximally correlated, the network contains the giant component for any nonzero link density. In contrast, when the degrees of a node are maximally anti-correlated, the emergence of the giant component is significantly delayed, yet the entire network becomes connected into a single component at a finite link density. We also discuss the mixing patterns and the cases with imperfect correlated multiplexity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modeling the Impact of Traffic Signals on V2V Information Flow</title>
      <link>https://jungyeol-kim.github.io/project/traffic-signal/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 21:13:14 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Information propagation in V2V-enabled transportation networks is highly influenced by both vehicle mobility and wireless communication. The mobility patterns and communication conditions are not only heterogeneous, but also vary both temporally and spatially. In particular, realistic traffic flow changes with time, exhibiting sharp time-triggered transitions, due to external factors such as traffic lights, unpredictable disruptions (e.g., accidents), and planned disruptions (e.g., road-block). More specifically, traffic signals cause traffic synchronization, due to vehicles stopping during the red phase, and starting almost simultaneously during the green phase, which fundamentally alters the dynamics of V2V message propagation in a complex manner. In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework, starting from a continuous-time Markov chain, that characterizes the fraction of vehicles that have received a message over time and space in an arbitrary road network even when the traffic flow exhibits sharp time-triggered transitions. Our framework can accommodate arbitrary traffic synchronization patterns corresponding for example to the presence of an arbitrary number of traffic signals. The stochastic model for V2V message flow converges to a set of differential equations as the number of vehicles increases. The analytical characterization lends itself to a fast computation regardless of the number of vehicles and traffic synchronization patterns, while vehicular network simulators can only realistically simulate small-scale transportation networks. We find that V2V simulations of a statistical model with traffic synchronization and simulation of communications applied on a synthetic traffic trace well match our model solution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tracing and testing multiple generations of contacts to COVID-19 cases: cost-benefit tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://jungyeol-kim.github.io/project/contact-tracing/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 21:13:14 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional contact tracing for COVID-19 tests the direct contacts of those who test positive even if the contacts do not show any symptom. But, by the time an infected individual is tested, the infection starting from the person may have infected a chain of individuals. Hence, why should the testing stop at direct contacts, and not test secondary, tertiary contacts or even contacts further down? One deterrent in testing long chains of individuals right away may be that it substantially increases the testing load, or does it? We investigate the costs and benefits of such multi-hop contact tracing for different number of hops. Considering a large number of contact topologies, spanning synthetic networks of divergent characteristics and those constructed from recorded interactions, we show that the cost-benefit tradeoff can be characterized in terms of a single measurable attribute, the initial epidemic growth rate. Once this growth rate crosses a threshold, multi-hop contact tracing substantially reduces the outbreak size compared to traditional contact tracing. Multi-hop even incurs a lower cost compared to the traditional contact tracing for a large range of values of the growth rate. The cost-benefit tradeoffs and the choice of the number of hops can be classified into three phases, with sharp transitions between them, depending on the value of the growth rate. The need for choosing a larger number of hops becomes greater as the growth rate increases or the environment becomes less conducive toward containing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
